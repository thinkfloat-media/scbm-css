# SCBM CSS
(super crazy bare minimum css)

The bare minimum css for a dark mode website, and slight styling changes to make starting projects and making prototypes easier.

This is a project I started in an effort to start new web based projects faster. The light mode also works, simply change the `color-scheme` css value to `light`.

To use, simply copy the `styles.css` in the root directory and import whatever way you need to. 

`index.html` has some examples of how to use the css, as there are certain ways you have to structure your html in order to get the most benefit from the css. There are no classes or ids used in the css in this project.
